# I-Take-Stew
The code for I Take Stew - a game jam game - https://shufflesninja.itch.io/itakestew

I Take Stew was created by Isaac Thompson, Brandon Hale, Madeleine Houser and Saunders Cox for the Virginia Tech Gaming Project Game Jam for Spring 2020. Isaac Thompson wrote the code in this repository with many references to the Unity 3D documentation - https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html

The code was written in a 48 hour period and supports two players moving on a tilemap with collisions and entity interactions. Enemies attempt to chase players while players attempt to collect stew and bring it back to the main entrance.

The music for the game, written by Brandon Hale, is dynamically chosen from a piecemeal set of soundtracks depending on the player's status. For example, if one of the players is dead or a player has collected enough stew, the music will increase in intensity. If the player has beat the game, the drums will drop out.
